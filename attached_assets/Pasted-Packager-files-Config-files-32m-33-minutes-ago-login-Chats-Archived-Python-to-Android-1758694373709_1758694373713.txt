I can help you convert your Python Flask web application into an Android APK. Since you have a task management system built with Flask, we'll need to create a React Native wrapper that communicates with your Python backend.

Let me create the necessary files for Android APK generation:

batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/App.js
Create React Native app entry point
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/package.json
Create package.json for React Native app
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/app.json
Create Expo configuration
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/eas.json
Create EAS build configuration
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/babel.config.js
Create Babel configuration
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/metro.config.js
Create Metro configuration
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/assets/.gitkeep
Create assets directory
Now, let me update your web app to handle CORS for mobile requests:

batman/batman/EAGLE/web_app.py
Add CORS support for mobile app, Enable CORS for all routes
Dependencies
flask-cors
Now, to build your APK, follow these steps:

First, deploy your Python backend using Replit's deployment feature so your mobile app can access it.

Install dependencies for the mobile app:

npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli
npm install
Update the API_BASE_URL in App.js to point to your deployed Replit URL.

Create an Expo account and login:

npx expo login
Initialize EAS build:
eas build:configure
Build the APK:
eas build --platform android --profile preview
The mobile app includes:

✅ Login with company selection
✅ Task list display with priority and status
✅ Task status updates (for non-admin users)
✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
✅ Real-time task management
✅ Secure API communication
After the build completes, you'll get a download link for your APK file that you can install on Android devices.

The recent code changes you proposed are outdated. Please try generating new file edits which accomplish the same goal.

I understand you want to convert your Python Flask web application into an Android APK. Looking at your codebase, I can see you have a React Native mobile app already set up in the mobile_app directory, but it needs to be properly configured and built.

Let me help you set up the mobile app to work with your Flask backend and then build it into an APK.

First, let's update the React Native app configuration:

batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/app.json
Update app configuration for APK build
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/App.js
Update API URL to use your Repl URL
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/assets/icon.png
Create placeholder icon
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/assets/splash.png
Create placeholder splash screen
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/assets/adaptive-icon.png
Create placeholder adaptive icon
batman/batman/EAGLE/mobile_app/assets/favicon.png
Create placeholder favicon
Now let's install the necessary dependencies for building the APK:

npm install
npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli
Now let's build the APK using EAS Build:

eas build --platform android --local
If you want to build it online (recommended), you can use:

eas build --platform android
The mobile app is already configured to work with your Flask backend. Once you run the build commands, you'll get an APK file that you can install on Android devices. The app will connect to your Flask web application running on Replit.

Note: You'll need to create an Expo account and log in with eas login before building. The build process will create an APK that can be installed on Android devices.
